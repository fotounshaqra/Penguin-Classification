# Penguin-Classification
Classification using various Machine Learning models (SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN) 

# Introduction
The Penguins dataset was used for developing machine learning models for classification purposes.
The dataset contains: 3 classes (different Penguins species), and then two numeric properties were selected to determine the species which were: Culmen Length and Culmen Depth.
Prediction: Different Species of Penguin.

# Dataset

# Purpose
One of the reasons I decided to make project was to try new machine learning classification concepts. I also wanted to use a dataset that isn't Iris. The project makes use of scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib libraries.

# Inspiration
I also came across a classification repository and decided to give it a try.
